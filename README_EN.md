Large Language Models (LLM), represented by ChatGPT and GPT-4, have sparked a new wave of research in the field of natural language processing, demonstrating capabilities of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and attracting widespread attention from the industry. However, the expensive training and deployment of large language models have posed certain obstacles to building transparent and open academic research.

To promote open research of large models in the Chinese NLP community, this project has open-sourced the **Chinese LLaMA model and the Alpaca large model with instruction fine-tuning**. These models expand the Chinese vocabulary based on the original LLaMA and use Chinese data for secondary pre-training, further enhancing Chinese basic semantic understanding. Additionally, the project uses Chinese instruction data for fine-tuning on the basis of the Chinese LLaMA, significantly improving the model's understanding and execution of instructions. Please refer to our technical report for further details [(Cui, Yang, and Yao, 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08177).

**Main contents of this project:**

- 🚀 Extended Chinese vocabulary on top of original LLaMA with significant encode/decode efficiency
- 🚀 Open-sourced the Chinese LLaMA (general purpose) and Alpaca (instruction-tuned) 
- 🚀 Open-sourced the pre-training and instruction finetuning (SFT) scripts for further tuning on user's data
- 🚀 Quickly deploy and experience the quantized version of the large model on CPU/GPU of your laptop (personal PC) 
- 🚀 Support [🤗transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), [LlamaChat](https://github.com/alexrozanski/LlamaChat), [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), , [privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT), etc.
- Released versions: 7B (basic, **Plus**), 13B (basic, **Plus**) , 33B (basic)

💡 The following image shows the actual experience effect of the 7B version model after local deployment (animation unaccelerated, tested on Apple M1 Max).

## Model Download

### ⚠️ User Notice (Must Read)

The official [LLaMA models released by Facebook prohibit commercial use](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), and the official model weights have not been open-sourced (although there are many third-party download links available online). In order to comply with the relevant licenses, it is currently not possible to release the complete model weights. We appreciate your understanding. After Facebook fully opens up the model weights, this project will update its policies accordingly. **What is released here are the LoRA weights**, which can be seen as a "patch" for the original LLaMA model, and the complete weights can be obtained by merging the two.

### Which model should I use?

The following table provides a basic comparison of the Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca models, as well as recommended usage scenarios (including, but not limited to). 

💡 **Plus versions** are trained on more data, which is highly recommended for use.

### Footnote and Others

**[1]** The original LLaMA model needs to be applied for use in [Facebook-LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) or refer to this [PR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/pull/73/files). Due to copyright issues, this project cannot provide downloads, and we ask for your understanding.

**[2]** The reconstructed model is slightly larger than the original LLaMA (due to the expanded vocabulary); the 7B model is about 13G+.

**[3]** After downloading, be sure to check whether the SHA256 of the ZIP file is consistent; for the full value, please see [SHA256.md](./SHA256.md).

**[4]** Merging steps for Alpaca-Plus are different from others, please refer to [wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/Manual-Conversion#multiple-lora-weights-merging-applicable-to-chinese-alpaca-plus).

**[5]** Also known as 30B model in elsewhere. There was a naming typo in release this model by Facebook. We stick to their original paper naming convention here (and also the actual numbers of weights).

The file directory inside the ZIP file is as follows (using Chinese-LLaMA as an example):

```
chinese_llama_lora_7b/
  - adapter_config.json       # LoRA weight configuration file
  - adapter_model.bin         # LoRA weight file
  - special_tokens_map.json   # special_tokens_map file
  - tokenizer_config.json     # tokenizer configuration file
  - tokenizer.model           # tokenizer file
```

The following is the size of each original model and 4-bit quantization. When converting the corresponding model, make sure that the machine has enough memory and disk space (minimum requirements):

|                    |   7B   |   13B   |   33B   |   65B   |

## System Performance

### Generation Performance Test

In order to quickly evaluate the actual performance of related models, this project compared the effects of Chinese Alpaca-7B, Alpaca-13B, Alpaca-Plus-7B, Alpaca-Plus-13B, and Alpaca-33B on some common tasks given the same prompt. Reply generation is random and is affected by factors such as decoding hyperparameters and random seeds. The following related evaluations are not absolutely rigorous, and the test results are for reference only. Welcome to experience it yourself. For detailed evaluation results, please see [examples](./examples).

### NLU Performance Test

This project also conducted tests on relevant models using the "NLU" objective evaluation dataset. The results of this type of evaluation are objective and only require the output of given labels, so they can provide insights into the capabilities of large models from another perspective. In the recently launched [C-Eval dataset](https://cevalbenchmark.com/), this project tested the performance of the relevant models. The test set contains 12.3K multiple-choice questions covering 52 subjects. The following are the evaluation results (average) of some models on the validation and test sets. For complete results, please refer to our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08177).

| Models                  | Valid (zero-shot) | Valid (5-shot) | Test (zero-shot) | Test (5-shot) |
| ----------------------- | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------------: | :-----------: |
| Chinese-Alpaca-33B      |       43.3        |      42.6      |       41.6       |     40.4      |
| Chinese-LLaMA-33B       |       34.9        |      38.4      |       34.6       |     39.5      |
| Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-13B |       43.3        |      42.4      |       41.5       |     39.9      |
| Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-13B  |       27.3        |      34.0      |       27.8       |     33.3      |
| Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-7B  |       36.7        |      32.9      |       36.4       |     32.3      |
| Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-7B   |       27.3        |      28.3      |       26.9       |     28.4      |

It is important to note that the comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of large models is still an urgent and significant topic to address. It is beneficial to approach the various evaluation results of large models in a rational and balanced manner to promote the healthy development of large-scale model technology. It is recommended for users to conduct tests on their own tasks and choose models that are suitable for the relevant tasks.

## Training Details

The entire training process includes three parts: vocabulary expansion, pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning. Please refer to [merge_tokenizers.py](scripts/merge_tokenizer/merge_tokenizers.py) for vocabulary expansion; refer to [run_clm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py) in 🤗transformers and the relevant parts of dataset processing in the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) project for pre-training and self-instruct fine-tuning.

We have open-sourced the scripts for pre-training and instruction finetuning (SFT): 

- Pre-training: [scripts/training/run_clm_pt_with_peft.py](./scripts/training/run_clm_pt_with_peft.py), refer to [Pre-training Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/Pretraining-Script)

- Instruction Finetuning: [scripts/training/run_clm_sft_with_peft.py](./scripts/training/run_clm_sft_with_peft.py), refer to [SFT Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/SFT-Script)

## FAQ

FAQ provides answers to frequent questions. Please see our FAQ before submitting an issue.

```
Q1: Why can't you release the complete model weights?
Q2: Will there be versions of 33B, and 65B in the future?
Q3: The model doesn't perform well on some tasks!
Q4: Why expand the vocabulary? Can't you just pre-train the original LLaMA with Chinese data?
Q5: The reply is very short
Q6: Under Windows, the model cannot understand Chinese, the generation speed is very slow, etc.
Q7: Chinese-LLaMA 13B model cannot be launched with llama.cpp, reporting inconsistent dimensions.
Q8: Chinese-Alpaca-Plus does not show better performance than the others.
Q9: The model does not perform well on NLU tasks, such as text classification.
Q10: Why 33B not 30B?
```

Please refer to our  >>> [📚GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/FAQ).

## Limitations

Although the models in this project have significantly improved Chinese understanding and generation capabilities compared to the original LLaMA and Alpaca, there are also the following limitations:

- It may produce unpredictable harmful content and content that does not conform to human preferences and values.
- Due to computing power and data issues, the training of the related models is not sufficient, and the Chinese understanding ability needs to be further improved.
- There is no online interactive demo available for now (Note: users can still deploy it locally themselves).
